### 👋 Hi, I'm Carlos Barcelos

I'm a **Mobile Engineer** with a strong focus on **Swift (SwiftUI & UIKit)** and **Kotlin Multiplatform**. I’ve been working on bridging iOS and Android codebases through shared architecture, helping teams deliver consistent experiences while reducing platform-specific duplication.

Currently, I’m working at **Stone Co.**, where I lead efforts to migrate legacy mobile apps to a **modern, modular architecture** using SwiftUI and KMP — integrating shared ViewModels, service layers, and state management across platforms.

#### 🛠️ Tech highlights
- **SwiftUI**, **UIKit**, **Combine**, **SwiftData**  
- **Kotlin Multiplatform**, **Jetpack Compose**, **Compose Multiplatform**  
- Shared logic across platforms, **modular codebases**, and **testable architectures**  
- Focus on performance, maintainability, and seamless migration paths
